# HunterLabsToken ERC20 Token Miner(Only command line working right now)

Solves proof of work to mine supported ERC20 tokens.  



<!-- ### Update 1.5.23 - 1000X CPU Pool Mining

This new build uses the C++ addon to accelerate the CPU mining one-thousand fold.  Pool mine with the command 'pool mine'.  Select a different pool with 'pool select http://...'.  Keep in mind that this update will migrate all vault data to a new and improved version so be sure to back up your private keys.  1.0.0 fixes bugs with solo mining and adds 'test mine' command.

---------------

### Getting Started
1. Build a new mining account with 'account new'
2. View the private key with 'account list'
3. Write down these credentials
4. Mine HunterLabsToken with the command 'mine'

Note that IF SOLO MINING it is necessary to fill the mining account (it is an Ethereum account) with a small amount of ether.  Typically 0.005 eth is good enough to get started.  The ether is used for gas to make function calls to the token smart contract when your miner finds a solution to the Proof of Work.  When the gas is spent that means that you have found a solution! If you were the first to find it, you will be rewarded with HunterLabsToken.  (See the block explorer for typical gas prices at the current moment.)



### Pool Mining(Not working yet)
- You can mine into a pool with the command 'pool mine'  
- When mining into a pool, your gasprice does not matter and you will pay NO GAS FEES  
- Every pool is different so consult each pool owner.  Typically, pools will offer a token withdraw mechanism or automatically send tokens to your address on a periodic basis or when a limit is reached



### Vault Datafiles

(requires 'show hidden files and folders')

Stored at:

- Windows
    '/Users/{user}/Appdata/Roaming/.hlt'

- Mac
    '/home/{user}/Library/Preferences/.hlt'

- Linux
    '/home/{user}/.hlt'




### Testing

npm run test
